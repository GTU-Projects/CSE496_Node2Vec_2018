text = """Roberto Baggio (born 18 February 1967) is a retired Italian footballer. He is widely regarded as one of the finest footballers of all time (4th at a Fifa internet poll; member of the Fifa World Cup Dream Team). Baggio won both the Ballon dâ€™Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year in 1993. He is the only Italian player ever scoring in three World Cups. He is also one of the top 5 all-time goalscorers for Italy. Baggio is known as Il Divin Codino (The Divine Ponytail), for the hairstyle he wore for most of his career and his Buddhist background.
